                <h2> Who are you? </h2>

                <p> My name is Cass. Sometimes I make things. I make websites, 3D models, and games. But usually websites. I use a variety of frontend and backend tools, and enjoy learning new tools. I don't like bad software. Let's make something good instead. </p>

        <h2> What's This? </h2>

        <p> This is my portfolio website, designed and developed from scratch. <em> No frameworks, libraries, or plugins, </em> and the only tools I used to make this site are 11ty and Nunjucks, to make content that exists on multiple pages easier to update, as well as SASS for some helpful styling features, like minor colour adjustments for things like the glow you see on certain elements. The below ticker is done with just CSS, and anywhere you see my projects or work being displayed is custom JavaScript fetching and displaying content from an external file.

        </p>

        <p>
        I did this because I wanted this site itself to be a showcase of my fundamental skills in web development, and not just a showcase of the ways that tools can make cool stuff easier and faster.

        <h2> What Can I Hire You To Do?</h2>

        <p> I make websites and 3D models, usually. I have experience with JAM and LAMP stack development, along with a stable base knowledge of HTML, CSS, JS and PHP, and experience working with Svelte, Pixi.JS, GSAP, and NPM. I'm also familiar with WordPress design and development. </p>

        <p> As far as 3D modelling goes, I'm experienced with hard modelling and sculpting in Blender, as well as texturing. </p>

        <p> Oh, and I also do Photography, character art and character design, but these are more hobbies for me than things I do for work. </p>

        <p> I primarily want to be hired full time, but I also do freelance work. If you'd like to contact me for work, please send an email to <a href="mailto:potentialenergyxyz@proton.me"> potentialenergyxyz@proton.me. </a> </p>

        <h2> Why "Potential Energy"? </h2>

        <p> Well, it sounds cool, for one. </p>

        <p> <em> But,</em> the concept of potential energy also represents my work and my ability to do work. Without the support of other people I've met throughout my life, and my own passions and desires, I wouldn't be where I am today. </p>
