Enter your Country, Province (or other type of administrative region) and City, and see what the weather's like right now, featuring images from Unsplash's API. The site has proper error handling in place, along with proper fallback images incase it runs out of Unsplash API calls. (It really never should naturally, as Unsplash's demo API is actually pretty generous, but during development it happened a few times and it was annoying me.) It also uses URL arguments to pass information between the first and second pages, as well as a media query to make the page look acceptable on most mobile devices.",
